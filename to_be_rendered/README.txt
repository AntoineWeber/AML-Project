To be able to run the different scripts presented in the .ipynb file, different 
libraries should be installed.

The file requirements.txt contains the different libraries installed in my environments
when running these scripts. Unfortunately no specific environments were created while
coding this project, hence unnecessary libraries are also present in this file.

To install all the present libraries, one should run in a terminal "pip install -r requirements.txt"
