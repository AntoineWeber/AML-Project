# Advanced Machine Learning Project

This repository contains the python files for our Advanced Machine Learning report. For this project we had to analyse two manifold learning algorithms: Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) and Hessian LLE (HLLE). There are 4 mains python notebooks:

* [create_toy_dataset.ipynb](create_toy_dataset.ipynb): Creates the toy datasets used for qualitative results and comparison
* [effect_hyper_parameters.ipynb](effect_hyper_parameters.ipynb): Analysis on the toy datasets
* [silhouette.ipynb](silhouette.ipynb): Analysis on the Calltech101 silhouette dataset
* [cancer_manifold.ipynb](cancer_manifold.ipynb): Analysis on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset.

For convenience, all 4 notebooks are merged into a single one: [to_be_rendered/Final.ipynb](to_be_rendered/Final.ipynb).

## Running the code

In addition to common python libraries (numpy, matplotlib, ...) this project has a few other dependencies mainly scikit. If you have trouble running this code, you can create a virtual python environment with the [requirements](to_be_rendered/requirements.txt).
